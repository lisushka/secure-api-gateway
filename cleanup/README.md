# Cleanup

Now that we're done with the lab, we need to clean up all of the resources that we used so that we don't get billed for them.

1. Navigate to the CloudFormation console, and select the `secure-api-stack` stack.  Click the `Delete` button, and wait for the stack to enter the `DELETE_COMPLETE` state.

1. Navigate to the EC2 console, and terminate the Cloud9 EC2 instance.  This will take 5-10 minutes.
